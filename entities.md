# Custom vocabulary

Entities allows you to extract data from a user expression. Ebbot provides predefined entities that can be used to extract data such as color, numbers, location, date and so on. You can also define your own entities for matching custom data. For example, you can define a car brand entity to that can match different brands to this particular entity and then re use the information in the dialog.

You can either use our built in entities or if you like, create your own custom one.
