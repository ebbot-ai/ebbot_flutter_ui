# CoBrowsing

The coBrowsing feature lets you initiate a screen sharing session once the conversation is between agent and user. It's useful in helpdesk and technical support when you need to assist the user on screen.&#x20;

Once a coBrowsing is active the chat will move to a new window so that the agent can see the users screen.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
The coBrowsing feature is currently in beta and it's only possible to share a desktop device. Mobile devices is not supported.
