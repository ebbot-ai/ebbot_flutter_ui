**Conversion Process**

The system uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to convert the Word document into a Markdown file, which is then integrated into EbbotGPT as split documents. This makes the content searchable, usable for generating responses and displaying them as sources in the chat widget whenever EbbotGPT uses the content in its responses.
