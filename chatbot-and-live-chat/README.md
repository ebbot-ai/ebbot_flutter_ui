# Chatbot & Live chat

### Chat widget API

Our chat chat widget API lets you customize the behaviour of the chat snippet. Useful if you would like to trigger the chat through a button on your page instead, trigger a different welcome scenario or add a behaviour that isn't supported out of the box in our application .

{% content-ref url="chat-widget-api.md" %}
[chat-widget-api.md](chat-widget-api.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Webhook

The webook integration allows you to use the knowledge and intent detection in your own application. By enabling the outgoing webhook you can listen to different events and act on it.&#x20;

{% content-ref url="webhook/" %}
[webhook](webhook/)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### SMS API

Our SMS API lets you send SMS through our SMS Gateway. It's possible to integrate directly to it or if you would like to integrate it in our application. Please get in contact to receive your token.&#x20;
