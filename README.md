# Ebbot Flutter UI

Ebbot Flutter UI is a flutter ui widget for implementing the Ebbot chat bot.
This widget encapsulates the logic in the `ebbot-dart-client` package and provides an drop-in ready solution for rendering a Ebbot Chat in your Flutter App.

## Notable technical dependencies

- This widget depends on the `flutter-chat-ui` package for rendering the chat ui
- It also depends on the `ebbot-dart-client` client library which wraps the business logic of the Ebbot Chat bot

## Demo app

A demo app that implements the `ebbot-flutter-ui` can be found in this repository: https://github.com/ebbot-ai/ebbot_flutter_ui_demo
This is a good starting point for anyone implementing the chat for the first time.
