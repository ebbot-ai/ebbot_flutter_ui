# Install popup

### Install the popup on your website <a href="#install-guides-on-your-website" id="install-guides-on-your-website"></a>

You need to install the script below on the webpage the guide should appear. Replace `YOUR_COMPANY_ID` with your company UUID.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://headless.dialogtrail.com/static/sdk.js?id=YOUR_COMPANY_ID&head=true"></script>
```

In your account, under Company settings, you can copy the script with the company ID already inserted.
