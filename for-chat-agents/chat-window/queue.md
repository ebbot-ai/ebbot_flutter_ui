# Queue

The queue system of Ebbot Chat is simple but very powerful. You can see all the chats in line that are associated  with your skill but also chats out side of the skill. Each chat shows how the user ended up in queue and for how long they have been waiting.&#x20;

## Minimized Queue

</div>

The left arrow lets you take the next chat in line. When you click on the big queue button it expands the queue&#x20;
